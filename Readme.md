==========

Improved settings and code templates for Eclipse

This project provides a set of plug-ins which:

* Registers several default file endings if the Eclipse text editor, because opening the system editor is typically not the desired behavior
* Adds more JDT templates for JFace, Android and Java programmer
* Configures the preference at startup of Eclipse to defaults we think have proven to be reasonable
